# Notes 

## 1. Responsiveness

I saw two different approaches to implement responsiveness:
    - Mobile First Design
    - Desktop First Design

I decided to go for mobile first design.

## 2. Add the {userId} API call

I made the API call on: "pages/user/[id].vue"

## 3. SSR vs. SPA

I compared the two rendering methods and took screenshots to compare the performance.
